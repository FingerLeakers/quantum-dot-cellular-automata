# Quantum Dot Cellular Automata

## Background

QCA is a computational nanotechnology based on field-coupled arrays of finite-state automata. QCA is a computational nanotechnology
based on field-coupled arrays of finite-state automata.The computational basis is defined as the two fully polarized configurations of
the cell.
